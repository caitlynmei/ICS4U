	 * Dynamic Programming Quiz
	 * 
	 * Given a number what are the fewest number of steps that can be taken to bring
	 * that number to 1 given a set of options that can be taken.
	 * 
	 * There will always be 3 options including the ability to subtract 1 from the
	 * number. The starting value and the 3 options (which you can divide the
	 * current n if possible) will be supplied in a file. The test file will contain
	 * x test cases and as a result will contain 2x lines. Where the first line is n
	 * and the second line is the 3 options in which you can use to divide and make
	 * your starting value smaller. [10T Marks]
	 * 
	 * The test file you should use for your testing should be created using the
	 * following test cases. State what steps were taken to achieve this. [5T Marks]
	 *
