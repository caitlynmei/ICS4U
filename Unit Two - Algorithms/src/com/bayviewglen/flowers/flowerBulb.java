	 * 3. You are planting a flower garden with bulbs to give you joyous flowers
	 * throughout the year. However, you wish to plant the flowers such that they do
	 * not block other flowers while they are visible.
	 * 
	 * You will be given a int[] height, a int[] bloom, and a int[] wilt. Each type
	 * of flower is represented by the element at the same index of height, bloom,
	 * and wilt. height represents how high each type of flower grows, bloom
	 * represents the morning that each type of flower springs from the ground, and
	 * wilt represents the evening that each type of flower shrivels up and dies.
	 * Each element in bloom and wilt will be a number between 1 and 365 inclusive,
	 * and wilt[i] will always be greater than bloom[i]. You must plant all of the
	 * flowers of the same type in a single row for appearance, and you also want to
	 * have the tallest flowers as far forward as possible. However, if a flower
	 * type is taller than another type, and both types can be out of the ground at
	 * the same time, the shorter flower must be planted in front of the taller
	 * flower to prevent blocking. A flower blooms in the morning, and wilts in the
	 * evening, so even if one flower is blooming on the same day another flower is
	 * wilting, one can block the other.
	 * 
	 * You should return a int[] which contains the elements of height in the order
	 * you should plant your flowers to achieve the above goals. The front of the
	 * garden is represented by the first element in your return value, and is where
	 * you view the garden from. The elements of height will all be unique, so there
	 * will always be a well-defined ordering.
